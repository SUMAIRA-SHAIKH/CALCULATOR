This is simple calcualtor program!

In the file name "simplecalculatorclass1" code is 2nd Ramzan-online class same coding of that class.

and file "userinput_calculator2" there is some changes, in this code using function method and I add some features like loop ( calculator ask to continue calculation or exit).

File no 3 "calculator_function" in that file I create function calling method but in output there is some problem they take all input from user then process
like enter 1st no, enter 2nd no, do u want to continue?, All 3 input taken then result shown ; but I want to result first than calculator ask to do u continnue or not?.

For this process in typescript we need to use (async/await-function);

and in last file "calculator_asyncfunc" I code through async Function with switch case method.
